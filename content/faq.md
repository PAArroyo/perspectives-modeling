# Materials for the course

## Required materials

* [ESL] Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2009) [*The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction*](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf), 2nd Edition. New York: Springer.
* [ISL] James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf). New York: Springer.
* [PRML] Bishop, C. (2006). *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. New York: Springer.
* [DLPyR]
    * Chollet, F. (2017). [*Deep learning with Python*](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). New York: Manning Publications.
    * Chollet, F. with J.J. Allaire (2018). [*Deep learning with R*](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r). New York: Manning Publications.
    * You only need to purchase one of these books. They are the exact same content, the only difference is the code examples are in Python vs. R.
    
## Software

All assignments will be completed using either [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/). You should have working distributions for either program setup on your computer, along with [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Optional materials

### For Python users

* VanderPlas, Jake. (2016). [*Python Data Science Handbook*](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/programming/python/9781491912126). O'Reilly Media, Inc.
* Warmenhoven, J. [`ISLR-python`](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python). A series of Jupyter Notebooks reproducing a selection of tables, figures, and lab sections in ISL using Python.

### For R users

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) -- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
* [The Tidynomicon: A Brief Introduction to R for Python Programmers](https://gvwilson.github.io/tidynomicon/)
* [`ggplot2`: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4) -- Hadley Wickham
* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) -- Hadley Wickham
* [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) -- printable cheat sheets for common R tasks and features

### Additional resources

* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) - DataCamp offers interactive R and Python courses on topics in data science, statistics, and machine learning. These are a supplement to our primary textbook and lessons. Introductory DataCamp courses are free, whereas premium courses generally cost a fee. As a participant in this course, you have free access to all premium courses for the duration of the term. None of the DataCamp modules are required for this course -- they are available purely as an optional component. You will receive an email in the first week of class inviting your to register. Make sure to sign up for an account using your UChicago email address, or the link will not work.

# How will I be evaluated?

Each week students will complete a series of problem sets linked to lecture materials. Each problem set will contain a mix of theoretical and application exercises. These assignments will generally be due the following week prior to Monday's class. Weekly lab sessions will be held to assist students in completing these assignments. While students are encouraged to assist one another in debugging programs and solving problems in these assignments, it is imperative students also learn how to do this for themselves. That is, **students need to understand, write, and submit their own work.**

Additionally, you will complete a cumulative final exam. Details about the final exam will be furnished near the end of the quarter.

| Assignment | Quantity | Points | Total Points | Percent |
|------------------|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Problem Sets | 10 | 10 | 100 | 83.3% |
| Final exam | 1 | 20 | 20 | 16.7% |
| **Total Points** | -- | -- | 120 | 100% |

Late problem sets will be penalized 1 point for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at 1:30pm, the following points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit.

| Example PR last commit | Points deducted |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 1:31pm to 2:30pm     | -1 point       |
| 2:31pm to 3:30pm       | -2 points       |
| 3:31pm to 4:30pm       | -3 points       |
| 4:31pm to 5:30pm       | -4 points       |
| 10:30pm and beyond      | -10 points (no credit) |
