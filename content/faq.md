# What do I need for this course?

**You will need to bring a computer to class each day.** Class sessions are a mix of lecture, demonstration, and live coding. It is essential to have a computer so you can follow along and complete the exercises.

## Textbooks/Readings

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) -- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
    * [Hardcover available for purchase online](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd)
    * Open-source online version is available for free

    > Completing the exercises in the book? No official solution manual exists, but several can be found online. I recommend [this version by Jeffrey B. Arnold](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/). Your exact solutions may vary, but these can be a good starting point.

### Additional resources

* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) - DataCamp offers interactive R and Python courses on topics in data science, statistics, and machine learning. These are a supplement to our primary textbook and lessons. Introductory DataCamp courses are free, whereas premium courses generally cost a fee. As a participant in this course, you have free access to all premium courses for the duration of the term. To activate your account, [click here](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/ed65341d4657ce236e87a5a953dbfc3fa3aa4225). Make sure to sign up for an account using your UChicago email address, or the link will not work.
* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4) -- Hadley Wickham
    * Excellent resource for the [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) graphics library.
* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) -- Hadley Wickham
    * Hardcover available online for around $55, but the online version is free
    * A deep dive into R as a programming language, not just a tool for data science. We will use some chapters in class, but most of this material is best covered on your own after completion of this course
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) -- Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani
    * [Hardcover is available online for around $70](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370)
    * Authenticated UChicago students can purchase a [softcover black-and-white edition for $25](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7)^[I don't recommend this since many of the figures rely on the use of color.] or download a PDF copy of the entire book for free
    * Non-UChicago students can find a free PDF of the entire book [from the authors' site](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf)
* [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
    * Printable cheat sheets for common R tasks and features

## Software

By the end of the first week (or even better, before the course starts), you should install the following software on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - easiest approach is to select [a pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio's IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R. You could use base R, but you would regret it.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Comprehensive instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](setup00.html).

# How will I be evaluated?

Each week students will complete a series of programming assignments linked to lecture materials. These assignments will generally be due the following week prior to Monday's class. Weekly lab sessions will be held to assist students in completing these assignments. While students are encouraged to assist one another in debugging programs and solving problems in these assignments, it is imperative students also learn how to do this for themselves. That is, **students need to understand, write, and submit their own work.**

Each homework will be evaluated by either myself or the TA, as well as by **two peer reviewers**. Each of you is required to provide two peer reviews for each assignment; failure to complete these reviews will result in a deduction of your final grade.

## Statement on Disabilities

If you need any special accommodations, please provide me (Dr. Soltoff) with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter (provided to you by the Student Disability Services office) as soon as possible so that you may discuss with me how your accommodations may be implemented in this course.
