<li>Final exam on fundamental theories/methods covered during the quarter</li>
<li>Closed-book, closed-note (i.e. no access to notes or the internet)</li>
<li>10-15 questions which require a written response. Bring a pen or pencil.</li>
<li>There is no programming component. You will not be asked to write code or quasi-code.</li>
<li>You do not need to memorize mathematical formulas for the exam. That said, you should be able to explain how different statistical learning algorithms work. Formulas and equations could help you, but are not necessary.</li>
<li>Answers must be <strong>complete</strong>. There is not a hard word count or expected length, but don’t try to skate by with the shortest answers possible. Incomplete answers will be penalized.</li>
</ul>
