## Overview

* Define statistical learning
* Distinguish between statistical and machine learning
* Assess the trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability
* Define and demonstrate the bias-variance trade-off
* Define decision theory and identify generic methods for evaluating the performance of statistical models

## Before class

* ISL ch 2
* PRML ch 1
    * Ch 1.2 is a succinct review of probability theory for those needing a refresher
    * Focus most closely on ch 1.5
