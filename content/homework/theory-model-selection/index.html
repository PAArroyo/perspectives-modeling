<p>For each of the following prompts, produce 800-1200 word written responses. Only PDF or <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> (<code>.md</code>) submissions will be graded. Using <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> is a great option - see the <a href="https://model.uchicago.edu/faq/#latex">recommended materials</a> to get started.</p>
<div id="deviant-aggressive-behavior" class="section level2">
<h2>Deviant aggressive behavior</h2>
<p>Consider four well-known and widely believed theories of socially deviant aggressive behavior (e.g. criminal behavior, revolutionary behavior, rude behavior):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theory I</strong>: Deviant aggressive behavior is learned from experience. Individuals in a society learn to do those things for which they receive rewards and to avoid those things for which they receive punishment.</li>
<li><strong>Theory II</strong>: Deviant aggressive behavior is a symbolic expression of hostility toward personal authority figures. When an individual is frustrated in his personal life, he becomes angry toward parents, bosses, or public officials. He will express this anger by deviant aggressive behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Theory III</strong>: Deviant aggressive behavior is the rational action of oppressed individuals. Social rules systematically discriminate among people. People who are most hurt by the rules are least likely to profit from conforming to them and thus do conform less.</li>
<li><strong>Theory IV</strong>: Deviant aggressive behavior is a social role. Individuals are socialized into the role through contact with a deviant subculture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What social policy would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior if Theory I were correct? Theory II? Theory III? Theory IV?</li>
<li>During the past ten years, American society has been running a series of “experiments” with deviant aggressive behavior. Take any one of these experiments (e.g. #MeToo, mass shootings, political rhetoric) and discuss what we have learned about the four theories from this series of experiments.</li>
</ol>

<div id="waiting-until-the-last-minute" class="section level2">
<h2>Waiting until the last minute</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>People often do things at the last minute (students turning in papers, professors grading exams, and so on).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Ask yourself <strong>why</strong> the observation might be true and write down your explanations.</li>
<li>Generalize the explanatory model – that is, induce the most general, abstract model you can produce that still has the original observation as a consequence.</li>
<li>Induce an alternative model that also has the original observation as a consequence.</li>
<li>For each of the two general models produced in (b) and (c), derive two interesting predictions (four predictions in total). Be sure the logical connection between your model and your predictions is explicitly stated and that any assumed facts concerning the world are made explicit.</li>

<h1>Selecting and fitting a model (5 points)</h1>
<p>For each of the following questions, produce brief written answers and/or the required graphs. Your responses must be readable on GitHub (i.e. we should not have to fork your repo to view the responses). Any questions requiring code should be reproducible. Recommended document formats are <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> rendered as PDF, Jupyter Notebook (<code>.ipynb</code>), or R Markdown (<code>.Rmd</code>) rendered as <code>github_document</code> or <code>pdf_document</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each part, indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is extremely large, and the number of predictors <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is small.</li>
<li>The number of predictors <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is extremely large, and the number of observations <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is small.</li>
<li>The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.</li>
<li>The variance of the error terms <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 = \Var(\epsilon)\)</span> is extremely high.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Bias-variance decomposition
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Generate a graph of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.</li>
<li>Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For classification problems, the test error rate is minimized by a simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class given its predictor values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Pr(Y = j | X = x_0)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is the test observation and each possible class is represented by <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. This is a <strong>conditional probability</strong> that <span class="math inline">\(Y = j\)</span>, given the observed predictor vector <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. This classifier is known as the <strong>Bayes classifier</strong>. If the response variable is binary (i.e. two classes), the Bayes classifier corresponds to predicting class one if <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y = 1 | X = x_0) &gt; 0.5\)</span>, and class two otherwise.</p>
<p>Figure 2.13 in [ISL] illustrates a simulated example defining the decision boundary for a hypothetical data set. Produce a graph illustrating this concept. Specifically, implement the following elements in your program:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Set your random number generator seed.</li>
<li>Simulate a dataset of <span class="math inline">\(N = 200\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(X_1, X_2\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X_1, X_2\)</span> are random uniform variables between <span class="math inline">\([-1,1]\)</span>.</li>
<li>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(Y = X_1 + X_1^2 + X_2 + X_2^2 + \epsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 0.25)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is defined in terms of the log-odds of success on the domain <span class="math inline">\([-\infty, +\infty]\)</span>. Calculate the probability of success bounded between <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>.</li>
<li>Plot each of the data points on a graph and use color to indicate if the observation was a success or a failure.</li>
<li>Overlay the plot with Bayes decision boundary, calculated using <span class="math inline">\(X_1, X_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Give your plot a meaningful title and axis labels.</li>
<li>The colored background grid is optional.</li>
