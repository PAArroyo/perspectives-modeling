# Overview

Due before class January 14th.

# Fork the `hw01` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/css-model/hw01) to fork the repo for homework 01.

# Building models (5 points)

For each of the following prompts, produce 800-1200 word written responses. Only PDF or [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (`.md`) submissions will be graded. Using $\LaTeX$ is a great option - see the [recommended materials](https://model.uchicago.edu/faq/#latex) to get started.

## Deviant aggressive behavior

Consider four well-known and widely believed theories of socially deviant aggressive behavior (e.g. criminal behavior, revolutionary behavior, rude behavior):

* **Theory I**: Deviant aggressive behavior is learned from experience. Individuals in a society learn to do those things for which they receive rewards and to avoid those things for which they receive punishment.
* **Theory II**: Deviant aggressive behavior is a symbolic expression of hostility toward personal authority figures. When an individual is frustrated in his personal life, he becomes angry toward parents, bosses, or public officials. He will express this anger by deviant aggressive behavior.
* **Theory III**: Deviant aggressive behavior is the rational action of oppressed individuals. Social rules systematically discriminate among people. People who are most hurt by the rules are least likely to profit from conforming to them and thus do conform less.
* **Theory IV**: Deviant aggressive behavior is a social role. Individuals are socialized into the role through contact with a deviant subculture.
    
Answer the following questions:
    
1. What social policy would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior if Theory I were correct? Theory II? Theory III? Theory IV?
1. During the past ten years, American society has been running a series of "experiments" with deviant aggressive behavior. Take any one of these experiments (e.g. #MeToo, mass shootings, political rhetoric) and discuss what we have learned about the four theories from this series of experiments.

## Waiting until the last minute

> People often do things at the last minute (students turning in papers, professors grading exams, and so on).

a. Ask yourself **why** the observation might be true and write down your explanations.
a. Generalize the explanatory model -- that is, induce the most general, abstract model you can produce that still has the original observation as a consequence.
a. Induce an alternative model that also has the original observation as a consequence.
a. For each of the two general models produced in (b) and (c), derive two interesting predictions (four predictions in total). Be sure the logical connection between your model and your predictions is explicitly stated and that any assumed facts concerning the world are made explicit.

# Selecting and fitting a model (5 points)

For each of the following questions, produce brief written answers and/or the required graphs. Your responses must be readable on GitHub (i.e. we should not have to fork your repo to view the responses). Any questions requiring code should be reproducible. Recommended document formats are $\LaTeX$ rendered as PDF, Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), or R Markdown (`.Rmd`) rendered as `github_document` or `pdf_document`.

1. For each part, indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
    a. The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.
    a. The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.
    a. The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
    a. The variance of the error terms $\sigma^2 = \Var(\epsilon)$ is extremely high.
1. Bias-variance decomposition
    a. Generate a graph of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The $x$-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the $y$-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.
    a. Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a).
1. For classification problems, the test error rate is minimized by a simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class given its predictor values:

    $$\Pr(Y = j | X = x_0)$$
    
    where $x_0$ is the test observation and each possible class is represented by $J$. This is a **conditional probability** that $Y = j$, given the observed predictor vector $x_0$. This classifier is known as the **Bayes classifier**. If the response variable is binary (i.e. two classes), the Bayes classifier corresponds to predicting class one if $\Pr(Y = 1 | X = x_0) > 0.5$, and class two otherwise.
    
    Figure 2.13 in [ISL] illustrates a simulated example defining the decision boundary for a hypothetical data set. Produce a graph illustrating this concept. Specifically, implement the following elements in your program:
    
    a. Set your random number generator seed.
    a. Simulate a dataset of $N = 200$ with $X_1, X_2$ where $X_1, X_2$ are random uniform variables between $[0,1]$.
    a. Calculate $Y = X_1 + X_1^2 + X_2 + X_2^2 + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(\mu = 0, \theta^2 = 0.25)$.
    a. $Y$ is defined in terms of the log-odds of success on the domain $[-\infty, +\infty]$. Calculate the probability of success bounded between $[0,1]$.
    a. Plot each of the data points on a graph and use color to indicate if the observation was a success or a failure.
    a. Overlay the plot with Bayes decision boundary, calculated using $X_1, X_2$.
    a. Give your plot a meaningful title and axis labels.
    a. The colored background grid is optional.
