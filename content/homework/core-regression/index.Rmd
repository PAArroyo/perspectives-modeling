# Overview

Due before class January 21th.

# Fork the `hw02` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/css-model/hw02) to fork the repo for homework 02.

# Submission format

For each of the following questions, produce brief written answers and/or the required graphs. Your responses must be readable on GitHub (i.e. we should not have to fork your repo to view the responses). Your repository should be split into 3 major documents:

1. Responses to conceptual exercises
1. Responses to Joe Biden exercises
1. Responses to voter turnout exercises

Each document should be **reproducible**. This means you need to commit and push all your code, output, and written text to complete the exercises. If necessary, I should be able to clone your repository and run all the code without any errors. Recommended document formats are Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or R Markdown (`.Rmd`) rendered as `pdf_document`.^[`html_document` cannot be viewed directly on GitHub.com, and GitHub does not properly render mathematical equations in `.md` documents `r emo::ji("sad")`]

# Conceptual exercises (5 points)

Note: when I specify for you to demonstrate or show **via simulation**, you should simulate the data-generating process a minimum of 1000 times to show that the basic principle holds true repeatedly. Unless otherwise specified, assume the number of observations $N = 1000$.

1. For the case of a bivariate regression $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, show via simulation that:

    a. The OLS estimator $\hat{\beta}_1$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta_1$.
    a. $\Var(\hat{\beta}_1)$ is increasing in $\sigma^2$.

1. Consider a model like:
    
    $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$
    
    where $Y, \boldsymbol{X}, \epsilon$ meet all the usual assumptions of the classical linear regression model, each $X_i$ is a random normal variable, $\text{corr} (X_1, X_2) \in (-1, 1)$ and $\text{corr} (X_1, X_3) = \text{corr} (X_2, X_3) = 0$.
    
    Using simulations, show:

    a. The relationship between $\text{corr} (X_1, X_2)$ and $\widehat{\se(\hat{\beta}_1)}$ for $N = 100$.
    a. The relationship between $\text{corr} (X_1, X_2)$ and $\widehat{\se(\hat{\beta}_3)}$ for $N = 100$.
    a. How the relationship changes as $N \rightarrow \infty$.

    Hint: To generate two random normal variables that are correlated to a particular degree:
    
    * Using R, [check out `mvrnorm()` from the `MASS` package](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/83172/generate-two-variables-with-precise-pre-specified-correlation).
    * Using Python, [check out `numpy.random.multivariate_normal()` from `numpy`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683821/generating-random-correlated-x-and-y-points-using-numpy).

## Sexy Joe Biden

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.thecrimson.com/photos/2014/10/02/103651_1299339.jpg)

[Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden) was the 47th Vice President of the United States. He was the subject of [many memes](http://distractify.com/trending/2016/11/16/best-of-joe-and-obama-memes), [attracted the attention of Leslie Knope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbMB_GGR6s), [experienced a brief surge in attention due to photos from his youth](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-young-hot_us_58262f53e4b0c4b63b0c9e11), and is a potential candidate for the 2020 presidential election.

`nes2008.csv` contains a selection of variables from the [2008 American National Election Studies survey](http://www.electionstudies.org/) that allow you to test competing factors that may influence attitudes towards Joe Biden. The variables are coded as follows:

* `biden` - feeling thermometer ranging from 0-100^[Feeling thermometers are a common metric in survey research used to gauge attitudes or feelings of warmth towards individuals and institutions. They range from 0-100, with 0 indicating extreme coldness and 100 indicating extreme warmth.]
* `female` - 1 if respondent is female, 0 if respondent is male
* `age` - age of respondent in years
* `dem` - 1 if respondent is a Democrat, 0 otherwise
* `rep` - 1 if respondent is a Republican, 0 otherwise
* `educ` - number of years of formal education completed by respondent
    * `17` - 17+ years (aka first year of graduate school and up)

1. Plot a histogram of `biden` with a binwidth of `1`. Make sure to give the graph a title and proper $x$ and $y$-axis labels. In a few sentences, describe any interesting features of the graph.
1. Estimate the following linear regression:

    $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_1$$
    
    where $Y$ is the Joe Biden feeling thermometer and $X_1$ is age. Report the parameters and standard errors.
    
    a. Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
    a. How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response?
    a. Is the relationship between the predictor and the response positive or negative?
    a. Report the $R^2$ of the model. What percentage of the variation in `biden` does `age` alone explain? Is this a good or bad model?
    a. What is the predicted `biden` associated with an `age` of 45? What are the associated 95% confidence intervals?
    a. Plot the response and predictor. Draw the least squares regression line.

1. It is unlikely `age` alone shapes attitudes towards Joe Biden. Estimate the following linear regression:

    $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_1 + \beta_{2}X_2 + \beta_{3}X_3$$
    
    where $Y$ is the Joe Biden feeling thermometer, $X_1$ is age, $X_2$ is gender, and $X_3$ is education. Report the parameters and standard errors.
    
    a. Is there a statistically significant relationship between the predictors and response?
    a. What does the parameter for `female` suggest?
    a. Report the $R^2$ of the model. What percentage of the variation in `biden` does age, gender, and education explain? Is this a better or worse model than the age-only model?
    a. Generate a plot comparing the predicted values and residuals, drawing separate smooth fit lines for each party ID type. Is there a problem with this model? If so, what?

1. Estimate the following linear regression:

    $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_1 + \beta_{2}X_2 + \beta_{3}X_3 + \beta_{4}X_4 + \beta_{5}X_5$$
    
    where $Y$ is the Joe Biden feeling thermometer, $X_1$ is age, $X_2$ is gender, $X_3$ is education, $X_4$ is Democrat, and $X_5$ is Republican.^[Independents must be left out to serve as the baseline category, otherwise we would encounter perfect multicollinearity.] Report the parameters and standard errors.
    
    a. Did the relationship between gender and Biden warmth change?
    a. Report the $R^2$ of the model. What percentage of the variation in `biden` does age, gender, education, and party identification explain? Is this a better or worse model than the age + gender + education model?
    a. Generate a plot comparing the predicted values and residuals, drawing separate smooth fit lines for each party ID type. By adding variables for party ID to the regression model, did we fix the previous problem?

1. Let's explore this relationship between gender and Biden warmth more closely. Perhaps the effect of gender on Biden warmth differs between partisan affiliation. That is, not only do we need to account for the effect of party ID in our linear regression model, but that gender has a different effect for Democrats and Republicans. Democrats are already predisposed to favor Joe Biden and have warm thoughts about him, whereas Republicans are predisposed to dislike him. But because Biden is so charming, he can woo female Republicans better than male Republicans. This suggests an **interactive** relationship between gender and party ID.

    Filter your dataset to remove any independent respondents (keeping only those who identify as Democrats or Republicans), and estimate the following linear regression:
    
    $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_1 + \beta_{2}X_2 + \beta_{3}X_{1}X_{2}$$
    
    where $Y$ is the Joe Biden feeling thermometer, $X_1$ is gender, and $X_2$ is Democrat. Report the parameters and standard errors.
    
    Estimate predicted Biden warmth feeling thermometer ratings and 95% confidence intervals for female Democrats, female Republicans, male Democrats, and male Republicans. Does the relationship between party ID and Biden warmth differ for males/females? Does the relationship between gender and Biden warmth differ for Democrats/Republicans?

## Modeling voter turnout

An important question in American politics is why do some people participate in the political process, while others do not? Participation has a direct impact on outcomes -- if you fail to participate in politics, the government and political officials are less likely to respond to your concerns. Typical explanations focus on a resource model of participation -- individuals with greater resources, such as time, money, and civic skills, are more likely to participate in politics. One area of importance is understanding voter turnout, or why people participate in elections. Using the resource model of participation as a guide, we can develop several expectations. First, women, who more frequently are the primary caregiver for children and earn a lower income, are less likely to participate in elections than men. Second, older Americans, who typically have more time and higher incomes available to participate in politics, should be more likely to participate in elections than younger Americans. Finally, individuals with more years of education, who are generally more interested in politics and understand the value and benefits of participating in politics, are more likely to participate in elections than individuals with fewer years of education.

While these explanations have been repeatedly tested by political scientists, an emerging theory assesses an individual's mental health and its effect on political participation.^[[Ojeda, C. (2015). Depression and political participation. *Social Science Quarterly*, 96(5), 1226-1243.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12173/abstract)] Depression increases individuals' feelings of hopelessness and political efficacy, so depressed individuals will have less desire to participate in politics. More importantly to our resource model of participation, individuals with depression suffer physical ailments such as a lack of energy, headaches, and muscle soreness which drain an individual's energy and requires time and money to receive treatment. For these reasons, we should expect that individuals with depression are less likely to participate in election than those without symptoms of depression.

The 1998 General Social Survey included several questions about the respondent's mental health. `mental_health.csv` reports several important variables from this survey.

* `vote96` - 1 if the respondent voted in the 1996 presidential election, 0 otherwise
* `mhealth_sum` - index variable which assesses the respondent's mental health, ranging from 0 (an individual with no depressed mood) to 9 (an individual with the most severe depressed mood)^[The variable is an index which combines responses to four different questions: "In the past 30
days, how often did you feel: 1) so sad nothing could cheer you up, 2) hopeless, 3) that everything was an effort, and 4) worthless?" Valid responses are none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, and all of the time.]
* `age` - age of the respondent
* `educ` - Number of years of formal education completed by the respondent
* `black` - 1 if the respondent is black, 0 otherwise
* `female` - 1 if the respondent is female, 0 if male
* `married` - 1 if the respondent is currently married, 0 otherwise
* `inc10` - Family income, in \$10,000s

1. Plot a histogram of voter turnout. Make sure to give the graph a title and proper $x$ and $y$-axis labels. What is the unconditional probability of a given individual turning out to vote?

1. Estimate a logistic regression model of the relationship between mental health and voter turnout.

    a. Is the relationship between mental health and voter turnout statistically and/or substantively significant?
    a. Interpret the estimated parameter for mental health in terms of log-odds. Generate a graph of the relationship between mental health and the log-odds of voter turnout.
    a. Interpret the estimated parameter for mental health in terms of odds. Generate a graph of the relationship between mental health and the odds of voter turnout.
    a. Interpret the estimated parameter for mental health in terms of probabilities. Generate a graph of the relationship between mental health and the probability of voter turnout. What is the first difference for an increase in the mental health index from 1 to 2? What about for 5 to 6?
    a. Estimate the accuracy rate, proportional reduction in error (PRE), and the AUC for this model. Do you consider it to be a good model?

1. Using the other variables in the dataset, derive and estimate a multiple variable logistic regression model of voter turnout. Interpret the results in paragraph format. This should include a discussion of your results as if you were reviewing them with fellow computational social scientists. Discuss the results using any or all of log-odds, odds, predicted probabilities, and first differences - choose what makes sense to you and provides the most value to the reader. Use graphs and tables as necessary to support your conclusions.
