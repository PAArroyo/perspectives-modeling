<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Definition of a model</h1>
<p>A <strong>model</strong> is a simplified representation of the real world.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They are simplified representations because it is impossible to represent the full complexity of the world, and because many minute details are unnecessary. Building models requires substantial trial-and-error; you build an initial model of some outcome of interest using a training set of observations and explanatory/predictor variables, evaluate its effectiveness based on its ability to correctly predict new observations, then revise your model to improve your predictions.</p>
<p><strong>This does not mean that models are evaluated purely on their predictive power</strong> – in fact, much of social science is focused on <strong>inference</strong>, or explaining causal relationships between variables. A model can have high predictive power, yet not explain clearly the relationship between variables or define how <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> to change. Certain statistical methods such as tree-based inference or deep learning can produce highly powerful models, yet have no clear explanation as to how <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> leads to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<div id="model-vs.theory" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Model vs. theory</h2>
<p><strong>Theory</strong> and <strong>model</strong> are frequently used interchangeably. Some texts such as <span class="citation">Lave and March (<a href="#ref-lave1993introduction">1993</a>)</span> define them to be the same thing. Others distinguish between the two concepts. <span class="citation">King, Keohane, and Verba (<a href="#ref-king1994designing">1994</a>)</span> defines a social science <strong>theory</strong> as “a reasoned and precise speculation about the answer to a research question, including a statement about why the proposed solution is correct” (p. 19), whereas a <strong>model</strong> is a simplification of, and approximation to, some aspect of the world. Models can take on many forms, including mathematical, verbal, or pictorial. Economists lean towards mathematical models using very precise (mathematical) language which enables them to succinctly define all the components and relevant variables in a model. Other fields such as sociology and political science have adapted some of these techniques (such as formal or game theory) to support their own research. Often though models may take on a less precise mathematical form, in favor of a textual description of the processes which explain or lead to the output of the model.</p>

<div id="steps-to-building-a-model" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> 7 steps to building a model</h1>
<p>Model building is a highly intricate process which really deserves its own course. Since we don’t have the time for that, we will simplify this and assert that models can take on many forms, but the basic premise is that they are a simplified representation of how the world works. We can construct models for any kind of relevant phenomena. In fact, we don’t even need data to evaluate the model (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis_A18/blob/master/Slides/PerspAnalysis_SimData.pdf">simulation methods</a>). Certainly though, data can prove very useful in evaluating the real-world usefulness of a model.</p>
<p>How then does one go about building a model? <span class="citation">Varian (<a href="#ref-varian2016build">2016</a>)</span> identifies several steps to formulating a model for a research project. While his article focuses primarily on economic models, there is still much we can generalize to the broader social sciences.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Three rules of thumb for model building</h3>
<p>See <span class="citation">Lave and March (<a href="#ref-lave1993introduction">1993</a>)</span> 2.9 for more detail.</p>
<div id="think-process" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.1</span> Think “process”</h4>
<p>A good model is almost always a statement about a process, and many bad models fail because they have no sense of process. When you build a model, look at it for a moment and see if it has some statement of process</p>
</div>
<div id="develop-interesting-implications" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.2</span> Develop interesting implications</h4>
<p>Much of the fun in model building lies in finding interesting implications in your models. In research you will repeatedly be asked to develop interesting implications from some model. Whether something is considered interesting obviously involves a judgment, but there is a good strategy for producing interesting predictions: look for natural experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="look-for-generality" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.3</span> Look for generality</h4>
<p>Ordinarily, the more situations a model applies to, the better it is and the greater the variety of possible implications. Finding generality involves the ordinary process of generalizing nouns and verbs.</p>
