# Definition of a model

A **model** is a simplified representation of the real world.^[This section is derived from @lave1993introduction.] They are simplified representations because it is impossible to represent the full complexity of the world, and because many minute details are unnecessary. Building models requires substantial trial-and-error; you build an initial model of some outcome of interest using a training set of observations and explanatory/predictor variables, evaluate its effectiveness based on its ability to correctly predict new observations, then revise your model to improve your predictions.

**This does not mean that models are evaluated purely on their predictive power** -- in fact, much of social science is focused on **inference**, or explaining causal relationships between variables. A model can have high predictive power, yet not explain clearly the relationship between variables or define how $X$ causes $Y$ to change. Certain statistical methods such as tree-based inference or deep learning can produce highly powerful models, yet have no clear explanation as to how $X$ leads to $Y$.

## Model vs. theory

**Theory** and **model** are frequently used interchangeably. Some texts such as @lave1993introduction define them to be the same thing. Others distinguish between the two concepts. @king1994designing defines a social science **theory** as "a reasoned and precise speculation about the answer to a research question, including a statement about why the proposed solution is correct" (p. 19), whereas a **model** is a simplification of, and approximation to, some aspect of the world. Models can take on many forms, including mathematical, verbal, or pictorial. Economists lean towards mathematical models using very precise (mathematical) language which enables them to succinctly define all the components and relevant variables in a model. Other fields such as sociology and political science have adapted some of these techniques (such as formal or game theory) to support their own research. Often though models may take on a less precise mathematical form, in favor of a textual description of the processes which explain or lead to the output of the model.

# 7 steps to building a model

Model building is a highly intricate process which really deserves its own course. Since we don't have the time for that, we will simplify this and assert that models can take on many forms, but the basic premise is that they are a simplified representation of how the world works. We can construct models for any kind of relevant phenomena. In fact, we don't even need data to evaluate the model (i.e. [simulation methods](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis_A18/blob/master/Slides/PerspAnalysis_SimData.pdf)). Certainly though, data can prove very useful in evaluating the real-world usefulness of a model.

How then does one go about building a model? @varian2016build identifies several steps to formulating a model for a research project. While his article focuses primarily on economic models, there is still much we can generalize to the broader social sciences.

1. Get an idea
1. Decide to pursue the idea
1. Examine the literature (or don't)
1. Build your model
1. Make mistakes
1. (Re)Turn to the literature
1. Give a seminar

## Get an idea

* Ideas are easy to generate - you want a **good** idea
* Where can you find ideas?
    * Academic journals
    * Newspapers, magazines
    * Talking to people (including non-academics)
* High-risk vs. high-reward

## Decide to pursue the idea

![Jeopardy! meme](https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/jeopardy.jpg)

* Can you phrase it as a question?
* Can you meaningfully explain it to a non-expert?
* Is it interesting?

## Examine the literature (or don't)

* When should you consult with the published literature?
* Don't look too soon
    * Potentially more work - could reinvent the wheel
    * Good practice
    * May come up with a different approach than what people have done before you
    * Generate new ideas just by beginning the process of modeling
* Eventually you will do a thorough review of the literature

## Build your model

* Identify the outcome of interest (**endogenous variable(s)**)
* Identify relevant variables that will explain, predict, and lead to understanding of the outcome of interest (**exogenous variables**)
* Work a simple example first
    * KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid

    > [Your model] should be as simple as possible...but no simpler.
* Then generalize your model piece by piece

### Three rules of thumb for model building

See @lave1993introduction 2.9 for more detail.

#### Think "process"

A good model is almost always a statement about a process, and many bad models fail because they have no sense of process. When you build a model, look at it for a moment and see if it has some statement of process

#### Develop interesting implications

Much of the fun in model building lies in finding interesting implications in your models. In research you will repeatedly be asked to develop interesting implications from some model. Whether something is considered interesting obviously involves a judgment, but there is a good strategy for producing interesting predictions: look for natural experiments.

#### Look for generality

Ordinarily, the more situations a model applies to, the better it is and the greater the variety of possible implications. Finding generality involves the ordinary process of generalizing nouns and verbs.

## Make mistakes

![Famous advice from Ms. Frizzle](https://i2.wp.com/www.sherrylwilson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Educents-Blog-6.png?w=570&ssl=1)

* You will make mistakes when building your model - that is okay!
* Building a model can be some of the most frustrating and rewarding parts of your research

## (Re)Turn to the literature

* If you have not already, begin your literature search
* Run searches on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* Talk to senior/junior colleagues
* Puts the value of your contribution in context
    * Very important for publication
* You may find out someone else already did what you did - it sucks

## Give a seminar

* Show your work to other people
    * Giving a seminar/talk is often the easiest way for both parties to communicate
* You can lose perspective when you are deep in the trenches of your project
    1. You may think something is obvious, when it is not to others
    1. You may think something is complicated, when it is really obvious

# Practice building a model

* What is the research question?
* What is the process in question?
* What are the key factors?
* What is exogenous, and what is endogenous?
* How can you get data on these things?

## Possible topics

* Murders are up in Chicago
* Effect of fake news on elections
* Effect of lying on political candidates
* When do you get married?
