<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Bagging</h1>
<p>Decision trees suffer from <strong>high variance</strong>: as we saw above, even a small change in the training/test set partitions can lead to substantial changes in the estimated model and resulting fit. However a method implementing <strong>low variance</strong> should provide more consistent estimates, regardless of the sample split. By <strong>bootstrap aggregating</strong>, or simply <strong>bagging</strong>, is a general method for reducing variance in estimates.</p>
<p>We already met the <a href="persp006_resampling.html#the_bootstrap">bootstrap</a>. Recall that this involves repeatedly sampling with replacement from a sample, estimating a parameter or set of parameters for each bootstrap sample, then averaging across the bootstrap samples to form our bootstrap estimate of the parameter. By averaging across all the bootstrap samples, we reduce the variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> in our final estimate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As this applies to statistical learning methods, we estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}^1(x), \hat{f}^2(x), \dots, \hat{f}^B(x)\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> separate training sets, and average across the models to generate a single low-variance model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{f}_{\text{avg}}(x) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b = 1}^B \hat{f}^b(x)\]</span></p>
<p>Since we don’t have that many training sets, we bootstrap them, just like how we <a href="persp006_resampling.html#estimating_the_accuracy_of_a_linear_regression_model">estimated bootstrap parameters for a linear regression model</a>. We estimate a decision tree model on each bootstrap sample and average the results of the models to generate the bagged estimate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{f}_{\text{bag}}(x) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b = 1}^B \hat{f}^b(x)\]</span></p>
<p>Each tree is grown without pruning, so they are high-variance but low-bias. Then by averaging across the results, we should get an estimate that has low-bias <strong>and</strong> low-variance. For regression trees this is straight-forward. For classification trees, we estimate <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> trees and for a given test observation assign it the <strong>majority-class result</strong>: the overall prediction is the most commonly occurring predicted outcome across all the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> predictions. Compared to the error rate for the corresponding classification tree, bagged estimates generally have slightly lower error rates.</p>
<div id="out-of-bag-estimates" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Out-of-bag estimates</h2>
<p>Fortunately using a bagged approach also allows us to avoid using any type of resampling method to calculate the test MSE or error rate. This is because we have a natural test set as a result of the bootstrapping process. Recall that in a bootstrap sampling process, we <strong>sample with replacement</strong>. This means that in some bootstrap samples, an observation may never be drawn. In fact, there is a pattern to this phenomenon. On average, each bagged tree uses approximately two-thirds of the original observations. Therefore observations not appearing in a given bag are considered <strong>out-of-bag observations</strong> (OOB).</p>

<p>Because of this, we can calculate the <strong>out-of-bag error estimate</strong>, or the average error estimate for out-of-bag observations. First we generate bagged predictions for each observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> using only its OOB estimates, then we average across all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> observations to get the OOB error estimate. This is a valid estimate of the test error rate/MSE because it only uses observations that were not part of the training observations for a given bag <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This is far more computationally advantageous than calculating a cross-validated error rate for a bagged model.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Variable importance measures</h2>
<p>Interpreting a bagged model is much more difficult than interpreting a single decision tree. Because each tree is unique, we cannot plot an “average” of the trees like we might with a bootstrapped linear model. The most common method of interpretation (beyond prediction accuracy) is <strong>variable importance</strong>, or attempting to assess how important each variable is to the model. In regression trees, for each predictor we calculate the total amount of reduction in the RSS attributable to splits caused by the predictor, averaged over the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> trees. For classification trees, we do the same thing using average reduction in the Gini index.</p>

<p>For classification trees, larger values are better. So for the Titanic bagged model, gender, age, and fare are the most important predictors, whereas number of siblings/parents aboard and the port of departure are relatively unimportant.</p>

<div id="random-forests" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Random forests</h1>
<p><strong>Random forests</strong> improve upon bagging by decorrelating the individual trees. The problem with bagging is that if there is a single dominant predictor in the dataset, most trees will use the same predictor for the first split and ensure correlation and similarity among the trees. Remember that the goal of bagging is to reduce the variance of our estimates of the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. But averaging across a set of correlated trees will not substantially reduce variance, at least not as much as if the trees were uncorrelated.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, when splitting a tree random forests will only consider a random sample <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of the total possible predictors <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. That is, it intentionally ignores a random set of variables. Every time a new split is considered, a new random sample <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is drawn. The main question then becomes how to select the size of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. ISL recommends <span class="math inline">\(m = \sqrt{p}\)</span>. By default, the <code>randomForest</code> package uses <span class="math inline">\(m = \sqrt{p}\)</span> for classification trees and <span class="math inline">\(m = \frac{p}{3}\)</span> for regression trees.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the results of the bagged Titanic model to the same model, only this time employing the random forest method:</p>

<p>The OOB error rate is a couple points smaller on the random forest model, and in the random forest model gender is no longer exclusively used to generate the first split for each tree. We can also observe that the average decrease in the Gini index associated with each variable is generally smaller using the random forest method compared to bagging - this is because of the variable restriction imposed when considering splits.</p>

<div id="boosting" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Boosting</h1>
<p><strong>Boosting</strong> is another approach to improve upon the result of a single decision tree. Instead of creating multiple independent decision trees through a bootstrapping process, boosting grows trees <strong>sequentially</strong>, using information from the previously grown trees. Rather than fitting a model to the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we fit a large number of decision trees <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}^1, \dots, \hat{f}^B\)</span> to the current <strong>residuals</strong>. Each time a new decision tree is estimated, the residuals are updated combining the results of all previous decision trees in preparation for fitting the next tree.</p>
<p>Rather than learning hard and fast like in bagging and random forests, boosting <strong>learns slowly</strong> over time as new trees are added. Because boosting is additive and slow, we can estimate fairly small trees and still gain considerable predictive power.</p>
<p>Boosting is a general process that can be used for other statistical learning methods. The three main tuning parameters when boosting are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <strong>number of trees</strong> <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is too large, boosting can overfit. Typically we would use cross-validation to select <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</li>
<li>The <strong>shrinkage parameter</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, which is a small positive number (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(.01\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(.001\)</span>). This controls the rate at which boosting learns. As <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> gets smaller, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> generally must increase.</li>
<li>The <strong>number of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> split in each tree</strong>. Surprisingly, <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span> actually works well which is essentially an additive model (each tree is a <strong>stump</strong> with a single predictor), though larger values of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are also common.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s evaluate all the approaches we’ve seen so far using the Titanic model.</p>

<p>Using bagging or random forest methods, the models quickly converge on a test classification error rate. This helps to demonstrate that for bagging and random forests, you do not need a particularly large <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to build a good model. For boosting, additional trees are necessary for the error rate to begin converging and stabilizing around a single value. We can use the <code>gbm.perf()</code> function to help determine the optimal number of boosting iterations based on either OOB, test set, or CV estimates of the error rate/MSE:</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The variance for each observation in an independent sample <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. The variance for the average of the sample <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Z}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\)</span>. By averaging across the observations, we reduce the estimated variance. Intuitively this makes sense because our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Z}\)</span> is based on more information, and should therefore be more stable.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
