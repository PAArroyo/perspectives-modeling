The **bootstrap** is a different resampling-based method for quantifying uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical method. It is extremely flexible and can be applied to virtually any statistical method.

# Generating samples

**Sampling without replacement** involves randomly sampling from a population whereby once an observation is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. Here I've drawn 10 random samples without replacement from the vector $`r 1:10`$:

```{r sim-sample-noreplace}
rerun(10, sample.int(10, replace = FALSE)) %>%
  bind_cols %>%
  as.matrix()
```

Drawing $10$ samples of size $10$ from an original population of $10$ observations would produce the exact same sample every time, just in a different order.

**Sampling with replacement** allows us to potentially draw the same observation multiple times, and ignore other observations entirely.

```{r sim-sample-replace}
rerun(10, sample.int(10, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  bind_cols %>%
  as.matrix()
```

Here I've drawn 10 random samples with replacement from the vector $`r 1:10`$. Each row contains a different sample. Notice how some rows contain multiples of the same values and exclude others entirely.

# Why use the bootstrap?

Statistical learning methods are frequently used to draw inferences about a population. Since you cannot directly measure the entire population^[Exception - [the Census](http://www.census.gov/2010census/).], you take a sample and ask a question of it instead. But how do you know your sample answer is close to the population answer? There are two approaches you can take:

1. Make **assumptions** about the shape of the population.
1. Use the **information in the sample** to learn about it.

## Making assumptions

![[When you assume](https://www.xkcd.com/1339/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/when_you_assume.png)

Suppose you decide to make assumptions, e.g. that the sample is distributed normally or [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) or some other probability distribution. You could learn about how much the answer to your question varies based on the specific sample drawn by repeatedly generating samples of the same size and asking them the same question. If you have a computaionally convenient assumption (such as the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)), you may even be able to bypass the resampling step and use a known formula to estimate your confidence in the original answer.

## Using information in the sample

![](/img/sample_pop_meme.jpg)

Provided you are happy to make the assumptions, this seems like a good idea. If you are not willing to make the assumption, you could instead take the sample you have and sample from it. You can do this because the sample you have **is also a population**, just a very small and discrete one. It is identical to the histogram of your data. Sampling with replacement merely allows you to treat the sample like it's a population and sample from it in a way that reflects its shape.

This is a reasonable thing to do for a couple reasons. First, it's the only information you have about the population. Second, randomly chosen samples should look quite similar to the population from which they came, so as long as you drew a random sample it is likely that your's is also similar.

# Estimating the accuracy of a statistic of interest

Suppose you want to know how often Americans eat ice cream in a given month.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Rockyroadicecream.jpg/800px-Rockyroadicecream.jpg)

We decide to estimate this by tracking a sample of 1000 Americans and counting how many times they eat ice cream over the course of a month.

```{r ice-sim}
# simulate the sample
set.seed(1234)
mu <- 5
n_obs <- 1000
ice <- tibble(sim = rpois(n_obs, lambda = mu))

ggplot(ice, aes(sim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Ice cream consumption in a month",
       y = "Frequency count")
```

The mean of this sample is `r mean(ice$sim)`, which we will treat as the population mean $\mu$. Remember that in the real world, we do not know $\mu$ because we have not observed all members of the population. Instead, we use the sample to estimate $\hat{\mu}$ on the assumption that the sample mean approximates the true mean.

The [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) is the most likely population distribution as it describes the count of event over time. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is

$$\Pr(X = x) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!}$$

where $\lambda$ is the event rate (average number of events per interval), $e$ is Euler's number, $y_i$ is an integer with range $[0, \infty]$, and $y_i!$ is the factorial of $y_i$. The mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$ of a Poisson distribution are the same parameter and hence are both defined by $\lambda$.

Because we are estimating $\mu$ from a sample, we should also estimate the **standard error** of the sample mean. This is necessary because any random sample drawn from a population will not exactly reproduce the population. We need to account for sampling error by estimating how much our sample mean $\hat{\mu}$ might differ from the true mean $\mu$.

The distribution of the mean of a set of samples is approximately [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).^[As defined by the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).] Therefore the standard error of the sample mean from a Poisson distribution is

$$\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{n}}$$

```{r ice-samp-mean}
mu_samp <- mean(ice$sim)
sem <- sqrt(mu_samp / n_obs)
```

The standard error of the sample mean is $`r sem`$. This is a good estimate **as long as the data generating process actually follows a Poisson distribution**. The Poisson distribution requires [several assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Assumptions:_When_is_the_Poisson_distribution_an_appropriate_model.3F). If any of these assumptions are violated, then the formula for estimating the standard error of the sample mean $\hat{\mu}$ will not be accurate.

In that situation, we can use the bootstrap to estimate the standard error without making any distributional assumptions. In this approach, we draw $B$ samples with replacement from the original sample. To estimate the population mean $\mu$ we calculate the mean of the bootstrapped sample means $\hat{\mu}_1, \hat{\mu}_2, \dots, \hat{\mu}_B$. To estimate the standard error of the sampling mean $\hat{\mu}$ we use the formula

$$SE_{B}(\hat{\mu}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{r = 1}^{B} \left( \hat{\mu}_r - \frac{1}{B} \sum_{r' = 1}^{B} \hat{\mu}_{r'} \right)^2}$$

What this boils down to is calculating the **standard deviation** of all the bootstrapped sample means. That gives us our standard error.

Let's bootstrap our standard error of the mean for our simulated ice cream data. We'll use $B = 1000$ to produce 1000 bootstrapped estimates of the mean, then calculate the standard deviation of them:

```{r ice-boot}
mean_ice <- function(splits) {
  x <- analysis(splits)
  mean(x$sim)
}

ice_boot <- ice %>%
  bootstraps(1000) %>%
  mutate(mean = map_dbl(splits, mean_ice))

boot_sem <- sd(ice_boot$mean)
```

```{r ice-boot-plot}
ggplot(ice_boot, aes(mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01, alpha = .25) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu, color = "Population mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu_samp, color = "Sample mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean),
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean) + 1.96 * boot_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean) - 1.96 * boot_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu_samp + 1.96 * sem, color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu_samp - 1.96 * sem, color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual",
                     name = NULL,
                     breaks = c("Population mean", "Sample mean",
                                "Bootstrapped mean")) +
  labs(x = "Bootstrapped sample mean",
       y = "Count") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the sample mean is `r boot_sem`. Compared to the original estimate of `r sem`, this is slightly closer to the defined population mean, but not by much. Why bother using the bootstrap? Because the bootstrap estimator will be more accurate **when the distributional assumptions are not met**.

Let's simulate the results once again, but draw the observations from a combination of the Poisson distribution and [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)).

```{r ice-sim2}
# simulate the sample
set.seed(113)
ice2 <- tibble(sim = c(rpois(n_obs / 2, lambda = mu),
                       round(runif(n_obs / 2, min = 0, max = 10))))

# plot the sample distribution
ggplot(ice2, aes(sim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Ice cream consumption in a month",
       y = "Frequency count")

# calculate sample mean and standard error
mu2_samp <- mean(ice2$sim)
sem2 <- sqrt(mu2_samp / n_obs)

# calculate the bootstrap
ice2_boot <- ice2 %>%
  bootstraps(1000) %>%
  mutate(mean = map_dbl(splits, mean_ice))
boot2_sem <- sd(ice2_boot$mean)

# plot the bootstrapped distribution
ggplot(ice2_boot, aes(mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu, color = "Population mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu2_samp, color = "Sample mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean),
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean) + 1.96 * boot2_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean) - 1.96 * boot2_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu2_samp + 1.96 * sem2, color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu2_samp - 1.96 * sem2, color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual",
                     name = NULL,
                     breaks = c("Population mean", "Sample mean",
                                "Bootstrapped mean")) +
  labs(x = "Bootstrapped sample mean",
       y = "Count") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The population mean $\mu$ is still defined as 5, but now look what happens to the standard errors of the estimates. The estimated means are identical under the formula-based or bootstrapped approaches (`r mu2_samp`), however the standard error for the sample-based approach is $`r sem2`$, compared to $`r boot2_sem`$. Because the bootstrap approach generates its estimate of the standard error directly from the data, the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval includes the population mean. However the 95% confidence interval under the formula-based method does not include the population mean. In this case we are better off using the bootstrapped standard error rather than using the formula for the Poisson distribution **because the data generating process was not strictly Poisson**. If you have doubts about your distributional assumptions, bootstrap estimates are a robust test of statistical inference.

# Estimating the accuracy of a linear regression model

In a linear regression model, the standard errors are statistical estimates of the average amount that the estimated parameters $\hat{\beta}$ differ from the true population parameters $\beta$. The formula for estimating standard errors for a linear regression model is:

$$\widehat{\se}(\hat{\beta}_j) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^{2} (X^{T}X)^{-1}_{jj}}$$

More simply this is the square root of the diagonal of the [variance-covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares#Finite_sample_properties). For the formula to hold, we make certain assumptions, including that our estimate of $\sigma^2$ is accurate and that any variability in the model after we account for $X$ is the result of the errors $\epsilon$. [If these assumptions are wrong, then our estimates of the standard errors will also be wrong.](/notes/ols-diagnostics/#non-constant-error-variance)

Let's revisit our `horsepower` and `mpg` linear model using the `Auto` dataset.

```{r auto-boot}
library(ISLR)

Auto <- as_tibble(Auto)

# plot the data and model
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# traditional parameter estimates and standard errors
auto_lm <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 1, raw = TRUE), data = Auto)
tidy(auto_lm)

# bootstrapped estimates of the parameter estimates and standard errors
lm_coefs <- function(splits, ...) {
  ## use `analysis` or `as.data.frame` to get the analysis data
  mod <- lm(..., data = analysis(splits))
  tidy(mod)
}

auto_boot <- Auto %>%
  bootstraps(1000) %>%
  mutate(coef = map(splits, lm_coefs, as.formula(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 1, raw = TRUE))))

auto_boot %>%
  unnest(coef) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(.estimate = mean(estimate),
            .se = sd(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The bootstrapped estimates of parameters are virtually identical, however the standard errors on the bootstrap estimates are slightly larger. This is because they do not rely on any distributional assumptions, whereas the traditional estimates do. Recall from the [cross-validation demonstration](/notes/cross-validation/#regression) that the relationship between horsepower and MPG is non-linear, so the residuals from a linear model will be inflated, and the residuals are used to estimate $\sigma^2$. The bootstrap method is not biased by these assumptions and gives us a more robust estimate.

If we compare the traditional and bootstrap estimates for the polynomial regression model, we find more similarity in our results:

```{r auto-boot-sq}
# traditional parameter estimates and standard errors
auto2_lm <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2, raw = TRUE), data = Auto)
tidy(auto2_lm)

# bootstrapped estimates of the parameter estimates and standard errors
auto2_boot <- Auto %>%
  bootstraps(1000) %>%
  mutate(coef = map(splits, lm_coefs, as.formula(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2, raw = TRUE))))

auto2_boot %>%
  unnest(coef) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(est.boot = mean(estimate),
            se.boot = sd(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))
```
