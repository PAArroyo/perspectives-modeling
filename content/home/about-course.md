# Course Description

Statistical learning methods are an important tool for computational social scientists seeking to conduct inference and prediction using observable data. This course presents a generic definition of a model in the social sciences, as well as a survey of a wide range of different types of statistical models used. While there is substantial overlap with the field of machine learning, this course focuses on methods emerging from statistics applied to supervised and unsupervised modeling, considering both the goals of inference and prediction. Students develop an understanding of the theory of how these methods work, assess the use of these models in published social scientific research, apply the methods computationally via Python or R, and interpret the substantive impact of the model results. As a survey course, students will be exposed to a wide range of modeling strategies, with the expectation that they later pursue deeper study into specific areas we cover.
  
# Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

* Define a range of statistical learning modeling strategies and demonstrate their theoretical properties
* Distinguish between modeling strategies and assess their individual strengths and weaknesses
* Read published research in the social sciences and analyze their modeling strategy
* Implement statistical learning algorithms using Python and/or R
* Utilize cross-validation methods
* Evaluate model performance
* Interpret the results of statistical models in terms of inference and prediction
* Visualize information and data using appropriate graphical techniques
* Apply statistical learning methods to standard (e.g. tabular) and non-standard (e.g. text, image, video) datasets
* Utilize stylistic principles of coding to generate reusable, interpretable code
* Debug programs for errors
* Generate reproducible research using computational notebooks such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
