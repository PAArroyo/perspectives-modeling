# Course Description

Students are often well trained in the details of specific models relevant to their respective fields. This course presents a generic definition of a model in the social sciences as well as a taxonomy of a wide range of different types of models used. We cover principles of model building, including static versus dynamic models, linear versus nonlinear, simple versus complicated, and identification versus overfitting. Major types of models implemented in this course include systems of nonlinear equations, linear and nonlinear regression, supervised learning (decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, etc.), and unsupervised learning. We will also explore the wide range of computational strategies used to estimate models from data and make statistical and causal inference. Students will study both good examples and bad examples of modeling and estimation. This course will give a quick overview of many topics and applied practice in problem sets with the hope that the students will later pursue deeper study into specific areas we cover.
  
# Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

* Construct and execute basic programs in R using elementary programming techniques and [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) packages (e.g. loops, conditional statements, user-defined functions)
* Apply stylistic principles of coding to generate reusable, interpretable code
* Debug programs for errors
* Identify and use external libraries to expand on base functions
* Generate reproducible research with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* Implement statistical learning algorithms
* Utilize cross validation methods
* Visualize information and data using appropriate graphical techniques
* Import data from files or the internet
* Munge raw data into a tidy format
* Scrape websites to collect data for analysis
* Parse and analyze text documents
* Implement programs via distributed computing platforms
* Create interactive web pages using [`flexdashboard`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
