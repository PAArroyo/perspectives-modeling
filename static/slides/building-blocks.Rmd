# Data representations for neural networks

* Tensor
* Generalization of vectors and matricies to higher-dimensions

---

# Tensor

## Scalars (0D tensors)

* A tensor containing a single number

--

## Vectors (1D tensors)

* A tensor with a one-dimensional array of numbers
* Has exactly one axis

```{r vector, collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(12, 3, 6, 14, 10)
str(x)
dim(as.array(x))
```

* 5D vector $\neq$ 5D tensor

---

# Tensor

## Matricies (2D tensors)

* A tensor with a two-dimensional array of numbers
* Two axes (frequently rows and columns)
* Visually is a rectangular grid of numbers

```{r matrix, collapse = TRUE}
x <- matrix(rep(0, 3*5), nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
x

dim(x)
```

---

# Tensor

## 3D tensors and higher-dimensional tensors

* Array of matricies

```{r 3d-tensor, collapse = TRUE}
x <- array(rep(0, 2*3*2), dim = c(2, 3, 2))
x
str(x)
dim(x)
```

---

# Key attributes

* Number of axes (rank)
* Shape
    * Matrix example - $(3,5)$
    * 3D tensor example - $(2,3,2)$
* Data type

--

## Data batches

* Samples axis
* Batching and batch axis

---

# Vector data

* 2D tensors of shape (`samples`, `features`)
* Each data point is encoded as a vector

---

# Actuarial dataset of people

## Variables

* Age
* ZIP code
* Income

--

## Data structure

* Person - vector of 3 values
* Dataset - 100,000 individuals
* 2D tensor of shape `(100000, 3)`

---

# Text documents

* Each document has a count of the frequency each word appears in it
* Dictionary of 20,000 words
* Document - vector of 20,000 values
* Documents - 500 documents

--

* 2D tensor of shape `(500, 20000)`

---

# Time series data

---

# Stock prices

## Variables

* Current price of a stock
* Highest price in the past minute
* Lowest price in the past minute
* Recorded every minute for a single stock

--

## Data structure

* Day of trading - 2D tensor of shape `(390, 3)`
* 250 days' worth of data - 3D tensor of shape `(250, 390, 3)`

---

# Image data

![](/img/fig-2-4.png)

---

# Video data

* Requires 5D tensor
* Each frame is a color image (`height`, `width`, `color_depth`)
* Sample of frames for a single video (`frames`, `height`, `width`, `color_depth`)
* Batch of videos (`samples`, `frames`, `height`, `width`, `color_depth`)

# Tensor operations

* Generalizations of matrix operations
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
* If you can do it with a matrix, you can do it with a tensor

# Gradient-based optimization

```
output = relu(dot(W, input) + B)
```

* `input`
* `dot()`
* `relu()`
* `W, b`

* Adjust the weights to produce the lowest loss score
* Initialize the weights with random values that are not useful

---

# Training loop

1. Draw a batch of training samples `x` and targets `y`
1. Forward pass - run the network on `x` to obtain predictions `y_pred`
1. Compute the loss of the network on the batch (mismatch between `y_pred` and `y`)
1. Update the weights of the network in a way that slightly reduces the loss on this batch

--

## Implementation

* Naive solution
* Differentiation

---

# Derivative

![](/img/fig-2-10.png)

---

# Derivative of a tensor operation

```
y_pred = dot(W, x)
loss_value = loss(y_pred, y)
```

```
loss_value = f(W)
```

```
loss_value = f(W0)
f'(W0)
```

---

# Stochastic gradient descent

1. Draw a batch of training samples `x` and targets `y`
1. Forward pass - run the network on `x` to obtain predictions `y_pred`
1. Compute the loss of the network on the batch (mismatch between `y_pred` and `y`)
1. Backward pass - compute the gradient of the loss with regard to the network's parameters
1. Move the parameters a little in the opposite direction from the gradient to reduce the loss for the batch

# Backpropogation

* Chained tensor operations

    ```
    f(W1, W2, W3) = a(W1, b(W2, c(W3)))
    ```

* Calculus and the chain rule

    ```
    f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)
    ```

--

* Backpropogation
    * Start with the final loss value
    * Work backwards from the top layers to the bottom layers
    * Apply the chain rule to compute the contribution that each parameter had in the loss value
