# Reproducible research

* What is reproducibility?
* Is it different from replicability?
* Why is reproducibility important?

---

# A new lexicon

* Methods reproducibility
* Results reproducibility
* Inferential reproducibility

---

# A new lexicon

## Methods reproducibility

* The provision of enough detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could, in theory or in actuality, be exactly repeated
* Observational vs. experimental research
* Level of detail can be intricate

--

## Results reproducibility

* Obtaining the same results from the conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as closely matched to the original experiment as possible
* Role of random error
* Defining successful results reproducibility
* Open Science Collaboration

--

## Inferential reproducibility

* Drawing of qualitatively similar conclusions from either an independent replication of a study or a reanalysis of the original study

---

# Inferential reproducibility

# Open source vs. open science

## Open source

* Data and code are openly available to public on some platform
* Encourages collaboration on projects
* Different open source licenses

--

## Open science

* Methods, equations, algorithms are openly available
* Does not necessarily mean exact code and data are available
* Focus on independent verification

---

# Open science

## How to verify

* Download someone else's code and data and see if you get the same result
* Verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ)

--

## Improve reproducibility

* Disclosure
* Registration and preanalysis plans
* Open data and materials

---

# Disclosure

* Systematically document and disclose key details about data collection and analysis
* Report all measures, manipulations, and data exclusions, as well as how they arrived at the final sample size
* Importance of documentation

---

# Registration and preanalysis plans

* Prospectively register comprehensive preanalysis plans
    * Hypotheses
    * Experimental protocol
    * Statistical modeling
    * Dependent variables
    * Covariates
    * Interaction terms

---

# Open data and materials

* Publish all relevant code and data for assessing the validity and reliability of the results

---

# Incentive structure

* Reproducibility is a fundamental assumption in science
* Nobody wants to publish merely confirmatory results
* Collective action problem

---

# American Journal of Political Science

> [Authors] must provide replication materials that are sufficient to enable interested researchers to reproduce all of the analytic results that are reported in the text and supporting materials...When the final draft of the manuscript is submitted, the replication materials will be verified to confirm that they do, in fact, reproduce the analytic results reported in the article.

---

# American Economic Review

> Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the AEA website. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

---

# American Sociological Review

> Sociologists share data and pertinent documentation as a regular practice. Sociologists make their data available after completion of the project or its major publications, except where proprietary agreements with employers, contractors, or clients preclude such accessibility or when it is impossible to share data and protect the confidentiality of the data or the anonymity of research participants (e.g., raw field notes or detailed information from ethnographic interviews)

---

# Make your code and data open source

* Use version control and transparency via Git and GitHub
* GitHub allows open access to contributions and attribution
* GitHub can become central to your CV/resume
* Begin contributing to open source projects now
* Open source through GitHub can encourage collaboration and build a professional network
* Give something, get something
    * Contribute to their code
    * Potentially get contributions back

---

# Use open software

* Easier to reproduce and validate than closed-source software
* Benefits of open software like Python, R, Julia
* Drawbacks of proprietary software like MatLab, Stata, SPSS

---

# Improve your research

1. Replication is a good first step
    * Ensures you have the tools necessary to extend research
    * Learn more deeply why researchers used certain tools and approaches
    * May find an error (unlikely, but could lead to publication)
    * Might find a better way to do the same thing (more likely, and could also lead to publication)
1. You are better able to contextualize your extension - why is it relevant? What is the value-added?
1. You will be in a better position to invite the original author(s) to collaborate
1. By open-sourcing your work, you are less threatening and more inviting
