# Writing the theory section

# Theories and models

* Model
* Theory

--

* Model is a simplification of a theory
    * Some models are mathematical
    * Some are less precise

---

# Types of models in CSS

## Formal model

* A set of cause and effect mathematical relationships between variables used to explain, predict, and understand phenomena
* Exogenous variables - inputs to the model, taken as given, from outside them odel
* Endogenous variables - output of the model
* Has both qualitative and quantitative implications

--

## Informal model

* Narrative qualitative descriptions of relationships between variables, sometimes backed by experimental or anecdotal evidence
* Often competing informal models are cited to show different possible relationships among variables
* Provides interpretability of results

---

# Theory vs. empirical strategy

* Theory
    * Statement of model (either formal or informal)
    * Provides interpretability of empirical results
    * Provides testable hypotheses
    * Assumes direction of causality
* Empirical strategy
    * What you do with your model and the data

---

# Pure theory papers

* Not what we do in this class
* Theory is the laboratory, rather than data
* Mathematical analysis can determine results
* Computational simulation can determine results

---

# Model section

* Model is the theoretical version of the data generating process
* It is a simplified version of reality
* What are the main pieces of your model?
* Why did you choose to model some parts of the real world and neglect others?
    * This has to do with your research question
* How do the parts of your model mathch up with the data?
* If much of the model is standard, you can summarize
    * Technical appendicies

---

# Theory/model section

## Annotated bibliography

* Provides the reader with an ordered list of sources for additional reading
* Includes brief explanations of why each source is credible and relevant to the topic
* Sources are separated from each other
* Brief citation and single paragraph explaining the credibility and relevancy

--

## Literature review

* Provides an overview of a particular topic or problem by summarizing and explaining the most significant sources in the field
* Sources are integrated into paragraphs based on the progression of the topical overview, and they may be mentioned more than once
* Uses an introduction to explain the topic, synthesizes sources progressively as the topic is explained through the body, and then concludes by summarizing the overall background presented

---

# Theory/model section

* Not an annotated bibliography
* Not a literature review
* Fleshes out your theory and model that you have developed
* Cites relevant literature as necessary to support your arguments and claims
* **Cannot just copy/paste your literature review into the paper as your theory section**

---

# Assessing a theory section

* [Kalla, J. L., &amp; Broockman, D. E. (2016). Campaign contributions facilitate access to congressional officials: A randomized field experiment. *American Journal of Political Science*, 60(3), 545-558.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12180)
* Read the intro/theory sections in class
* In small groups:
    * What is the question being answered?
    * What are the key concepts?
    * Write out the model(s) being evaluated
    * Identify how the article uses sources/citations to support their arguments
