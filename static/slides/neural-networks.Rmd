# Models

## Network architecture

* Directed, acyclic graph of layers
* Linear stack of layers
* Hypothesis space
* No clear guidelines for defining network architecture

--

## Loss functions and optimizers

* Loss function
* Optimizer

---

# Keras

* Deep-learning framework that provides a convenient way to define and train almost any kind of deep learning model
* Runs on CPU or GPU
* Easy to work with API
* Works with many kinds of networks

---

# Keras vs. Tensorflow

* Model-level library
    * Keras
* Tensor library
    * TensorFlow
    * Theano
    * Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)

---

# Typical workflow

1. Define your training data
1. Define a network of layers that maps inputs to your targets
1. Configure the learning process by choosing a loss function, an optimizer, and some metrics to monitor
1. Iterate on your training data

---

# Setting up a deep-learning workstation

* Have a powerful GPU (typically NVIDIA)
* CPU processing is for chumps
* Can be run on the cloud via RCC/AWS/Google Cloud

# Binary classification: IMDB dataset

* Set of 50,000 highly-polarized reviews from IMDB
* 25,000 for training
* 25,000 for testing
* Each has 50% negative and 50% positive reviews

---

# Import data

```{r imdb-import, results='hide', collapse = TRUE}
library(keras)

imdb <- dataset_imdb(num_words = 10000)
c(c(train_data, train_labels), c(test_data, test_labels)) %<-% imdb
```

```{r imdb-str, collapse = TRUE}
str(train_data[[1]])
train_labels[[1]]
```

* Word indicies
* One-hot-encoding

```{r imdb-reshape, include = FALSE}
vectorize_sequences <- function(sequences, dimension = 10000) {
  # Create an all-zero matrix of shape (len(sequences), dimension)
  results <- matrix(0, nrow = length(sequences), ncol = dimension)
  for (i in 1:length(sequences))
    # Sets specific indices of results[i] to 1s
    results[i, sequences[[i]]] <- 1
  results

# Building our network

* Activation functions enable non-linear transformations

---

# Compiling the network

```{r imdb-compile}
model %>% compile(

* Binary crossentropy
* `rmsprop` optimizer
* Monitor accuracy during training

# Conclusions

* Data usually requires preprocessing to encode it as a tensor
* Stacks of dense layers with `relu` activations solve a wide range of problems
* Always end binary classification with a dense layer with one unit and `sigmoid` activation
* Use binary crossentropy with binary classification
* `rmsprop` optimizer is usually a good starting place
* Avoid overfitting

# Wrapping up

* Regression uses different loss functions from classification
* Evaluation metrics differ as well
* Rescale features with values in different ranges
* With little data, use $K$-fold CV
* With little data, use a small network with few hidden layers to avoid overfitting

---

# Evaluating machine learning models

* Want to build generalizable models
* Requires strong performance on held-out or test data
* Need to measure the reliability of the model not solely on the training data

---

# Validation

* Training/validation/test sets
* Simple hold-out validation
* $K$-fold validation
* Iterated $K$-fold validation

--

## Things to consider

* Data representativeness
* Arrow of time

---

# Data preprocessing

* Convert your data to an appropriate tensor of floating-point numbers (or integers)
* Rescale your data to a standardized range
* Account for missing values
* Feature engineering

---

# Feature engineering

---

# Overfitting and underfitting

* Tension between optimization and generalization
* Underfitting
* Once generalization stops, model begins to overfit

--

## Solutions

* Get more training data
* Reduce the network's size
* Regularization
* Dropout

---

# Reducing the network's size

* Reduce the size of the model (capacity)
* But not too much
* Best determined via trial and error

---

# Original model

  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

original_model %>% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("accuracy")

# Smaller model

```{r imdb-model-small}

  layer_dense(units = 4, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(10000)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 4, activation = "relu") %>%

# Universal workflow of machine learning

1. Define the problem and assemble a dataset
1. Choose a measure of success
1. Decide on an evaluation protocol
1. Prepare your data
1. Develop a model that performs better than the baseline
1. Develop a model that overfits
1. Regularize your model and tune your hyperparameters
1. Retrain a final time on all training data and evaluate using the test data
