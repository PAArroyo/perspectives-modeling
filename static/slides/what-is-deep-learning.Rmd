# Learning from data

## Artificial intelligence

* Effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
* Includes, but not limited to, ML and DL

--

## Machine learning

* Computer going beyond what we know to learn how to perform a specified task
* Classical programming
* Machine learning
* Relationship to statistics

---

# Learning representations from data

1. Input data points
1. Examples of the expected outputs
1. A way to measure whether the algorithm does a good job

* Meaningful transformations
* Different representations work better for different transformation processes

---

---

# The "deep" in deep learning

* Rather than implementing a single transformation, build successive layers of representations
* Depth
* Deep vs. shallow learning
* Layers are learned via neural networks

# A brief history of machine learning

* Probabilistic modeling
* Early neural networks (1980s)
* Kernel methods
* Tree-based inference
* Back to neural networks

---

# Deep learning

## Why is deep learning different

* Much better performance on many problems
* Lack of feature engineering

--

## Why deep learning now?

* Hardware
* Data
* Algorithms

--

## Benefits of deep learning

* Simplicity
* Scalability
* [Versatility and reusability](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/04/not-hotdog.html)

---

# When to use deep learning

* Truly large data sets
* Expect lots of non-linearity
* Don't care about causal inference or explanation
* Common data types
    * Images
    * Text
    * Video
    * Not usually standard tabular spreadsheet data
